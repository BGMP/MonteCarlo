# Monte Carlo PI Calculation
This project implements the Monte Carlo method for approximating the value of $\pi$, both in a sequential and parallelized version using OpenMP. The parallel implementation takes advantage of multiple CPU threads to improve performance and reduce computation time.

## Building
For GUI based building, use the Code::Blocks project file.

## Notes

This project was written as part of the Masters in Computer Science course "Parallel Computing" at the University of the Bío-Bío.

Some of the TeX/PDF files are in Spanish, as the course was taught in Spanish.
