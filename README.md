# Monte Carlo PI Calculation
This project implements the Monte Carlo method for approximating the value of $\pi$, both in a sequential and parallelized version using OpenMP. The parallel implementation takes advantage of multiple CPU threads to improve performance and reduce computation time.

## Building
For GUI based building, use the Code::Blocks project file.
